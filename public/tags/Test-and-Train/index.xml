      <description>To create the best model which generalizes well to new unseen data. You must ensure that your test set serves as a proxy for actual dataset IE it represents the new dataset.
 Overview The very first step after pre-processing of the dataset is to split the data into training and test datasets. We usually split the data around 70%-30% between training and testing stages. The training set is the one that we use to learn the relationship between independent variables and the target variable.</description>
