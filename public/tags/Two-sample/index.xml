      <description>Hypothesis testing uses concepts from statistics to determine the probability that a given assumption is valid. In this chapter, you will learn about several types of statistical tests, their practical applications, and how to interpret the results of hypothesis testing.

Typically hypothesis testing starts with an assumption or an assertion about a population parameter.</description>
