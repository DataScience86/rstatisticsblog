      <description>While building a Machine Learning model, do not throw away all of your information! Normalize your features.
 Overview It is a general requirement for many machine learning algorithms to have features with similar scales. It is important because if we pass features with different scales to algorithms like SVMs, perceptronâ€™s, neural networks, optimization algorithms in logistic regressions, and more prominently, you can think of algorithms which use gradient descent will end up having a faster update for some feature values as compared to others.</description>
