      <description>Introduction In this quick tutorial, we will cover essential concepts of R programming language. It is not a zero to hero tutorial. However, this course does proffer you with all the necessary information to achieve data analysis related tasks in R.
Installation The installation of R software is pretty straight forward and is like any other software. First, you need to download the R software IDE (Interactive Development Environments).
Download RIf you have installed the R software as guided.</description>

      <description>Overview Ross Ihaka and Robert developed R at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. They started working on the tool in 1933 to help their students. However, they were then encouraged to make it open source. The language is based on another single letter programming language called S, primarily it is called S+, and it still exists.
One of the major reasons for the popularity of R is that R and its packages are Open Source and Free.</description>

      <description>Conditions and Loops In R Conditional statements in R programming language enables the user to execute a statement based upon a particular condition or criteria. On the other hand, the loops ensure that the same task is executed again and again.
Having knowledge and understanding of how the two work is extremely critical for any programmer. As a data analyst or a data science practitioner, you will be using them quite often.</description>

      <description>Functions in R By now you must have figured it out that R programming is not a traditional programming language. The language is a collection of functions that are packed together to form a package. All thanks to the open and free community, which has contributed to over 9000 packages over the years. Today one can find any function to achieve almost any statistical task in R by doing a little research.</description>

      <description>Data Manipulation Tasks With Example Code As a data analyst, you will be working mostly with data frames. And thus, it becomes vital that you learn, understand, and practice data manipulation tasks. This chapter will focus on listing down some of the most common data manipulation tasks along with example code.
Before, we start and dig into how to accomplish tasks mentioned above. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to access the datasets which come along with the R packages.</description>
