Data manipulation tasks such as aggregations, add/remove/update of columns, joins, reading large files, etc., are all very important for any data science-related project. Keeping all these operations into mind, Matt Dowle and Arun Shrinivasan created a package called data.table.
data.table package is an extension of data.frame package in R. It is one of the first choices for data scientists while they work on large datasets.</description>
