## Welcome to rstatisticsblog.com
This website is designed to serve as a self-help guide to those who seek to gain knowledge on topics related to statistical computing, machine learning, R programming concepts, predictive modeling, forecasting, and data visualization.

Here, you will find articles in chronological order, with reproducible R code and examples. The goal is to help you understand how to apply the data science concepts without the use of never-ending theory and fancy math. That is why all the articles are pretty straightforward, simple and include clear examples covering concepts of [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats), [#rstatistics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstatistics), [#MachineLearning](https://twitter.com/hashtag/machinelearning) and [#DataScience](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScience).

## Structure of the website/book
The website is broken down into five sections.

* **R Programming Tutorial**- If you are entirely new to R, this section is a perfect place to start.
* **Data Science In Action** - Under this section, we will be covering concepts from the following two fields:
  * **Statistics** - These concepts will enable you to summarize, draw conclusions, and make a reliable forecast to improve business activities
  * **Machine Learning Algorithms** - We will be covering a gamut of supervised and unsupervised algorithms. In this section, we will help you learn both fundamental and advanced machine learning techniques.
* **Most Popular R Packages Tutorials** - This section will enable you to learn some of the topmost downloaded R packages. Knowledge of these packages will further allow you to build powerful skills in terms of how to load, manipulate, visualize, and model data.
* **Other Useful Techniques** - Techniques like variable selection, model tuning, pre-processing, and parallel processing are some example topics which we intend to cover in this section.
* **Blog/Articles** - In this section, I will cover use cases, R programming tips, and things that I have learned over the years as part of my job as a data scientist.
