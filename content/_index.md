## Welcome to rstatisticsblog.com

R Statistics blog is an education site covering topics related to data science. The blog contains free tutorials on everything related to statistics, machine learning, natural language processing and data visualization.

Here, you will find articles in chronological order, with reproducible R code and examples. The goal is to help you understand how to apply the data science concepts without the use of never-ending theory and fancy math. That is why all the articles are pretty straightforward, simple and include clear examples covering concepts of [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats), [#rstatistics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstatistics), [#MachineLearning](https://twitter.com/hashtag/machinelearning) and [#DataScience](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScience).

## Structure of the website/book
The website is broken down into five sections.

* **R Programming Tutorial**- If you are entirely new to R, this section is a perfect place to start.
* **Data Science In Action** - Under this section, we will be covering concepts from the following two fields:
  * **Statistics** - These concepts will enable you to summarize, draw conclusions, and make a reliable forecast to improve business activities
  * **Machine Learning Algorithms** - We will be covering a gamut of supervised and unsupervised algorithms. In this section, we will help you learn both fundamental and advanced machine learning techniques.
* **Most Popular R Packages Tutorials** - This section will enable you to learn some of the topmost downloaded R packages. Knowledge of these packages will further allow you to build powerful skills in terms of how to load, manipulate, visualize, and model data.
* **Other Useful Techniques** - Techniques like variable selection, model tuning, pre-processing, and parallel processing are some example topics which we intend to cover in this section.
* **Blog/Articles** - In this section, I will cover use cases, R programming tips, and things that I have learned over the years as part of my job as a data scientist.
